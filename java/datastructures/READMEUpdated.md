# Data Structures

## Implementation Notes

## Code Challenge 05

Methods:
- Insert
- Includes
- toString in a specified format

Test were also written that:

- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

NOTE:Tests must be run one at a time due to a "rg.junit.platform.launcher.core.EngineDiscoveryOrchestrator lambda$logTestDescriptorExclusionReasons$7
INFO: 0 containers and 3 tests were Method or class mismatch" error I receive when doing all at once.

This challenge was completed with the resources of Class Github, Youtube, GPT.

## Code Challenge 06

Methods:
- Append
- Insert Before
- Insert After

Test were also written that:
- Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
- Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
- Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
- Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
-

## Code Challenge 07

Methods:
KTH From End

Test were also written that:
- Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
- Where k and the length of the list are the same
- Where k is not a positive integer
- Where the linked list is of a size 1
- “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list
-
This challenge was completed with teamwork from Alex Chao. Whiteboard img attached for our planning process.<br>
We did have to look up the dual pointer process and have a written example to follow from which we drew.

## Code Challenge 08

Linked List Zip

This challenge was a whiteboard to pseudo code event in which we attempt to explain out way
through taking multiple args in the form of linked list and combining them into a sintle output.

## Code Challenge 10

Stack and Queue

This challenge was to hand-write methods for Stacks: Push, Pop, Peek, isEmpty and Queues: enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty.
