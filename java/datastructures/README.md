## Code Challenge 05

Methods:
- Insert
- Includes
- toString in a specified format

Test were also written that:

- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

NOTE:Tests must be run one at a time due to a "rg.junit.platform.launcher.core.EngineDiscoveryOrchestrator lambda$logTestDescriptorExclusionReasons$7
INFO: 0 containers and 3 tests were Method or class mismatch" error I receive when doing all at once.

This challenge was completed with the resources of Class Github, Youtube, GPT.
